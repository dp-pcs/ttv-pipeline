### ‚úÖ Complex Prompts (5+ segments = 25+ seconds)

#### Example 1: Multi-Location Journey
```
A young explorer with a vintage leather backpack begins at the edge of an ancient forest, walking along a moss-covered stone path. As morning mist swirls around towering oak trees, she discovers a hidden waterfall cascading into a crystal-clear pool. She kneels to collect water in a glass vial, then continues deeper into the forest where rays of golden sunlight filter through the canopy. Finally, she emerges into a sunny meadow filled with wildflowers, where she sits on a fallen log to examine her collected samples. Cinematic lighting, nature documentary style, shot with tracking camera movements and close-up details.
```

#### Example 2: Character Story Arc  
```
A master chef in a busy restaurant kitchen starts by carefully selecting fresh ingredients from wooden crates, examining tomatoes and herbs under warm kitchen lighting. He moves to a marble prep station where he precisely chops vegetables with practiced knife skills, steam rising from nearby pots. Next, he crafts handmade pasta, flour dusting the air as he works the dough with rhythmic motions. The camera follows as he moves to the stove, tossing ingredients in a sizzling pan with dramatic flame bursts. Finally, he artfully plates the finished dish, garnishing with microgreens and drizzling sauce with the precision of an artist. Professional kitchen lighting, documentary style with smooth camera movements.
```

#### Example 3: Action Sequence
```
A parkour athlete stands at the edge of an urban rooftop at sunset, surveying the cityscape below. She takes a running start and leaps across a narrow alley gap, landing with a perfect roll on the adjacent building. Moving fluidly, she vaults over air conditioning units and slides under low obstacles while the camera tracks her movements. She approaches a fire escape and swings down multiple levels with acrobatic precision, her movements casting dynamic shadows in the golden hour light. The sequence concludes as she lands gracefully in a courtyard, raising her arms in triumph while the camera pulls back to reveal the impressive height she just descended. Urban cinematography with dynamic camera work and dramatic lighting.
